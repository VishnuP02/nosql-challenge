In this challenge, I evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help the journalists of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, and food critics decide where to focus future articles.
I used my knowledge of MongoDB and PyMongo to complete this challenge. 

Resources used to complete this challenge:
    - Lecture slides, class recordings, AskBCS sessions with Learning Assistants, Angel Milla, Tristen Ortiz, and Garret Frank
